In circuit one you can see the current is split between the two branches and there is a lower amount of current going through the circuit that has 470 ohms of resistence then the circuit that has 330 ohms of resistance.
In circuit two the ohm value of the two resistors is added to create 800 ohms of resistance. The current going through the whole circuit if very low due to the high resistance but it has the same current over the whole circuit but the voltage drops as it goes through the resistors.
In circuit three
